## Bravo
FIRST: (.java)
	02:20 - done reading & paper
	10:56 - examp pass
		Time limit exceeded on test 46
	16:44 - examp pass

	20:58 - examp pass
		Time limit exceeded on test 46

	First try I unnecessarily used a SegmentTree.
	Second try I used cumul arrays
	Third try I realized problem was slow i/o, tried some rearranging but no success.

	26:37 - examp pass
		Time limit exceeded on test 46

	I guess reading whole file in was not good enough.
	Lets try nextLine instead of nextInt

	37:22 - maximally optimized Scanner implementation with simultaneous output
		Time limit exceeded on test 46

	39:59 - only nextLine on input with simultaneous output
		Time limit exceeded on test 4 (four not 46), lol

	44:54 - buffered reader with simultaneous output	
		Time limit exceeded on test 46	

	hmmmm, all other people solutions use Scanner.nextInt ?? and pl ??

	54:39 - merged for loops as much as possible, no helper functions.
		Time limit exceeded on test 46

	xx:xx - Accepted

	I managed to do it with Scanner.nextInt
	The trick was not to allocate any base arrays but just cumul arrays.
	Big memory allocation is really slow I guess.
	Fastest solutions use custom reader so I guess I should have one of my own.

	xx:xx - developed FastScanner
