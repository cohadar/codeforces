2016-02-20 | Round #343 | http://codeforces.com/contest/629
	Failed because I did not finalize paper on both C and D.
	Also D was better for me than C, so I should have done them out of order!

	Took to much time on A instead of just strait coding brute.
	On B failed to get the paper right in first try
	Read C, decided that is sounds too simple to be easy
	Read D, decided it was too complex with too many detail
	Read E, decided it was hard but that I had all I need to solve it. 
	Unfortunately E used a sparse SegmentTree and I only had dense one in my library, waster 42 min.
	Worked on D and got it working with 1 min left and then notices it needs online algorithm and I made offline one. 
	In short, I risked and I lost, and I was not prepared enough.

	Started 10 min late.
	Failed pretest 5 on A because of blind-spot
	Done B in 10 min - perfect
	Lost 30 min extra on C because of wrong boundaries, and not using debug, and not developing code gradually.

	A - solve under 10
	B - Lasted 40min, too long, due to not doing paper properly (bad TreeMap idea) 
		This problem has simpler solution than I made, I just neglected to do paper properly (and paid the price in time)
	C - blindsight - failed because of special case - (d == 1 && n > 2) - argh, do your petite manually!
	D - was very close to solution, but had insufficient math. (actually had bad math)
	E - did not attempt
2016-03-30 | Round #346
	A - 5m, failed because of off by one.
	B - 22m, lost some time because of bad naming / renaming.
	C - 10m, great time, but code was short naturally.
	D - 34m, lost 10m because of not careful reading / starting conditions. +enum ordinal modulo.
	E - 28m, lost 10m because of renaming and incomplete paper.
	F - 37m, failed because of time pressure, had it 99% complete.
		lost precious time & introduced bugs because of stupid n,m variable names.
		also lost time because neglected to use functions and got bugged down in too long if/for code.
		Actually, I had bad paper because I did not read properly, but it was solvable nonetheless.
	E - did not attempt
2016-04-24 | Round #348
	A - 5m
	B - 14m
	C - skip
	D - failed (too tired from GCJ practicing)
	
2016-04-29 | Round #349
	A - 10m
	B - skip (geometry)
	C - simple memoization, did wrong paper, GCJ training fatigue, timeout
	D -
