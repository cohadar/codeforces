2016-02-20 | Round #343 | http://codeforces.com/contest/629
	Failed because I did not finalize paper on both C and D.
	Also D was better for me than C, so I should have done them out of order!

2016-02-28 | 8VC Venture Cup 2016 - Final Round (Div. 2 Edition) | http://codeforces.com/contest/635
	Took to much time on A instead of just strait coding brute.
	On B failed to get the paper right in first try
	Read C, decided that is sounds too simple to be easy
	Read D, decided it was too complex with too many detail
	Read E, decided it was hard but that I had all I need to solve it. 
	Unfortunately E used a sparse SegmentTree and I only had dense one in my library, waster 42 min.
	Worked on D and got it working with 1 min left and then notices it needs online algorithm and I made offline one. 
	In short, I risked and I lost, and I was not prepared enough.

2016-03-19 | India Hacks 2016
	Started 10 min late.
	Failed pretest 5 on A because of blind-spot
	Done B in 10 min - perfect
	Lost 30 min extra on C because of wrong boundaries, and not using debug, and not developing code gradually.

2016-03-28 | VKCup2016Round1Div2
	A - solve under 10
	B - Lasted 40min, too long, due to not doing paper properly (bad TreeMap idea) 
		This problem has simpler solution than I made, I just neglected to do paper properly (and paid the price in time)
	C - blindsight - failed because of special case - (d == 1 && n > 2) - argh, do your petite manually!
	D - was very close to solution, but had insufficient math. (actually had bad math)
	E - did not attempt

2016-03-30 | Round #346
	A - 5m, failed because of off by one.
	B - 22m, lost some time because of bad naming / renaming.
	C - 10m, great time, but code was short naturally.
	D - 34m, lost 10m because of not careful reading / starting conditions. +enum ordinal modulo.
	E - 28m, lost 10m because of renaming and incomplete paper.
	F - 37m, failed because of time pressure, had it 99% complete.
		lost precious time & introduced bugs because of stupid n,m variable names.
		also lost time because neglected to use functions and got bugged down in too long if/for code.
		Actually, I had bad paper because I did not read properly, but it was solvable nonetheless.
	E - did not attempt

2016-04-24 | Round #348
	A - 5m
	B - 14m
	C - skip
	D - failed (too tired from GCJ practicing)
	
2016-04-29 | Round #349
	A - 10m
	B - skip (geometry)
	C - simple memoization, did wrong paper, GCJ training fatigue, timeout
	D - 

2016-05-05 | Round #350 | great meta-play won the day. Would be even better had I used proper teplates for harder problems.
	A - 10m
	B - 10m
	C - 17m
	D1 - 10m
	D2 - skip
	E - skip
	F - 1h25m

2016-05-07 | Round #351 | Lost a lot of points due to speed.
	A - 5m
	B - first skipped for C, around 25m after D midfail
	C - 27m, a bit slow because of inproper naming.
	D - had haizenbug for more than 1h, this hurt me the most, >>>solved it with a single personal pretest<<<
	E - read & avoided
	F - read & avoided

2016-05-11 | Round #352 | DO NOT play the hacking game, you are at a disantvantage because most people use C++.
	A - 3m
	B - 5m
	C - 1h
	D - skipped this for hacking game, bad decision. (-100 points for 2 bad hack attempts, urgh)
	
2016-05-16 | Round #353 | This round demonstrated importance of basic math skills.
	A - 13m, simple equation, but I got stupid instead of writing it down first.
	B - 45m, Again simple math equations that took me waaay too much time to straighten out.
	C - skipped because I saw a lot of people solving D over C
	D - 1h9m, Had a bad paper but corrected myself, submitted 5m before end, the best way :) 
	E -
