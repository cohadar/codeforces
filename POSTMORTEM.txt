2016-02-20 | Round #343 | http://codeforces.com/contest/629
	Failed because I did not finalize paper on both C and D.
	Also D was better for me than C, so I should have done them out of order!

	Took to much time on A instead of just strait coding brute.
	On B failed to get the paper right in first try
	Read C, decided that is sounds too simple to be easy
	Read D, decided it was too complex with too many detail
	Read E, decided it was hard but that I had all I need to solve it. 
	Unfortunately E used a sparse SegmentTree and I only had dense one in my library, waster 42 min.
	Worked on D and got it working with 1 min left and then notices it needs online algorithm and I made offline one. 
	In short, I risked and I lost, and I was not prepared enough.
