http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/158/B | great interview question - simple for and if's ~ 20m
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/274/A | smarter is simpler
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/276/C | you don't need FenwickTree for this.
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/295/A | great array manipulation practice, invers cumul.
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/343/B | easy problem, hard visualisation, 49m, it pays to spend time on nice drawings
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/348/A | very evil
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/349/B | simple text, nice algo.
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/433/B | big input reading and array memory reuse
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/455/A | radix + max trick
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/466/C | need to be careful with ranges + smarter is simpler
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/467/C | nice example of removing DP ifs with proper for bounds
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/474/B | binarySearch - highBound
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/476/B | smarter is simpler
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/501/C | when you think you need a priority queue, but you actually need a simple queue
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/513/A | smarter is simpler
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/518/C | reminds you to use long for sum
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/520/C | nice solution, hard insights
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/534/B | tricky DP with both start and end conditions
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/538/C | index/range manipulation
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/550/B | nice brute bit
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/570/C | makes you think you need interval tree, but no.
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/597/A | great interview question
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/602/B | smarter is simpler, two pointers, use range arithmetic
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/607/A | DP is simpler if you invert min to max
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/652/A | zero case and boundaries nightmare
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/658/C | petite cases disciplines
